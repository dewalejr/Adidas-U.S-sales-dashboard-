## Insights
The Western region generated the highest revenue with West Gear leading the chart. To continue to grow the topline, the next signature footwear could be endorsed by an athlete/celebrity from the West.

In both years, men's street footwear dominated the charts with revenues in excess of $200m. 

While other outlets generated revenues across the three sales methods, West Gear's revenues were majorly earned through the In-store sales method which poses a concentration risk.
